                <p>Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI) is a global cleantech company operating in energy from waste (EfW) and renewable gas. Our roots are in Switzerland, where we were established in 1933 as “L. von Roll Aktiengesellschaft”, later known as Von Roll Inova. Since 2010 we have been part of the Hitachi Zosen Corporation, one of Japan’s largest industrial and engineering firms and a longstanding partner and licensee of Von Roll Inova. To this day we foster the spirit of a traditional Swiss company combined with the know-how and economic strength of an international group.</p>
                <p>We have been building and maintaining plants for almost 90 years. We develop projects with our clients and then draw on our experience as a general engineering, procurement and construction contractor to deliver on their behalf complex turnkey plants and system solutions for thermal and biological EfW recovery, gas upgrading and power to gas. We also offer comprehensive, expert and reliable after-sales services for operators of existing plants. Quality is our greatest asset. Our unconditional endeavours to achieve this quality, together with our long experience and honest commitment, are what we pass on to clients.</p>
                <p>The challenge of finding the best possible solutions for our clients, again and again, is what drives us. We work with them closely to find and develop integrated solutions to their individual needs and requirements – solutions based on a blend of proven technologies and passionate innovation that meet the highest quality, efficiency and environmental protection standards. This is why we’re among the market leaders in our field: We love what we do.</p>
